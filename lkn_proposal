"Linux Kernel in a Nutshell" book proposal.

This book would provide a full reference for how to build a customized
version of the Linux kernel.  It will cover all of the needed basics,
and go into full detail with all of the different kernel configuration,
build, and boot options that are available.

The book will only cover the 2.6 kernel, and hopefully the most recent
version possible.

It will not cover any programming topics, and no programming experience
will be needed to understand and use the book.  However some additional
information in the appendix will be present to help people out in
becoming kernel developers, if they so wish.

The book will be released under the Creative Commons
Attibution-ShareAlike License, as defined at
	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/
and also be available in full online, in the same formats as the book
"Linux Device Drivers".


Proposed chapter outline:

- Introduction or Foreword from some other kernel developer
- Kernel History and Background (just a few pages)
- Retrieving the kernel source
- Building a kernel
	- use the the default configuration options
	- basic options to make (full coverage will be in later
	  chapter).
	- building a kernel with the source in one place, and the output
	  in another.
	- building only a portion of the kernel tree
	- building a kernel for a different architecture
- Installing a built kernel and booting with it
	- grub
	- lilo
	- other boot loaders
- Upgrading the kernel to the next version
	- retrieving the patch
	- applying the patch
	- updating the configuration
	- building the updated kernel
- Configuring a kernel
	- customizing it for the hardware on your machine
	- building modules
	- Common configuration options
		- USB
		- power management
		- acpi
		- filesystems
		- firewire
		- other common things that users need.
- Customizing the initramfs / initrd image
- Kernel boot command line reference
- Kernel build command line reference
- Kernel configuration option reference
	- will be only the most "important" ones, and will be the bulk
	  of the book (although the previous chapters will not be
	  "light".)

Appendixes:
 - Becoming a kernel programmer
 	- basics of creating a patch
	- how to submit a valid patch and to whom
 	- kernelnewbies
	- kernel janitor project
- Managing changes made to a kernel source tree
	- based on the ideas presented at
	  http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6183
- Creating useful bug reports
	- decoding a oops message
	- what a kernel developer wants to see in a bug report.
	- who to send the report to.

About the author:

Greg Kroah-Hartman is the Linux kernel maintainer of more subsystems
that he wants to admit (USB, PCI, I2C, and the driver core being a few
of them.)  He is also one of the co-authors of the book, "Linux Device
Drivers", and is a contributing editor for Linux Journal Magazine,
publishing a bi-monthly column about Linux driver development.  He
has worked as a Linux kernel engineer for the past 5 years, and been
involved in the Linux kernel community for much longer.
