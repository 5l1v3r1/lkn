kernel source tree invoves a lot of different steps, as this book has
shown.  Developers being naturally lazy creatures, they have created
some programs to help with the various routiene tasks.  Here we describe

<para>
ketchup is a very handy tool that is used to update or switch between
different versions of the Linux kernel source tree.  It has the ability
to:
 - find the latest version of the kernel, download it, and uncompress
   it.
 - update a currently installed version of the kernel source tree to any
   other version, by patching the tree to the proper version.
 - It can handle the different development and stable branches of the
   kernel tree, including the -mm and -stable trees.
 - it will download any patches or tarballs needed to do the update, if
   they are not present on the machine already.
 - it checks the GPG signatures of the tarball and patches to verify
   that it has downloaded a correct file.
