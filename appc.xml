<title>
Creating useful bugreports
</title>

<para>
So, your kernel just crashed and you want to help the kernel developers out
and send them a bug report so that the problem will have a chance to get
fixed (if you don't let them know, odds are it will never get fixed.)  But
how do you do this?  What kind of information do they need to help fix the
problem?  This appendix will go over the basics of how to create a useful
bug report, and how to send it to the proper group of people.
