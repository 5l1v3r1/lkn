<para>
A USB Storage device is in reality a USB SCSI device that talks over a
USB connection.  Because of this, the SCSI subsystem must be enabled:
	Device Drivers
		SCSI Device Support
			<*> SCSI Device Support

Also in the SCSI system, the "SCSI disk support" must be enabled in
order for the device to be mounted properly:
	Device Drivers
		SCSI Device Support
			<*> SCSI disk support

Then, enable USB support for the kernel:
	Device Drivers
		USB Support
			<M> Support for Host-side USB

As well as the USB Host controllers which will enable USB to work
properly on the machine:
	Device Drivers
		USB Support
		---   USB Host Controller Drivers
		<M>   EHCI HCD (USB 2.0) support
		<M>   OHCI HCD support
		<M>   UHCI HCD (most Intel and VIA) support
Then enable USB Storage support:
	Device Drivers
		USB Support
		<M> USB Mass Storage support

If you wish, there are a number of specific USB storage devices listed
as separate configuration items, as they do not follow the standard USB
specification and require special code.  If you have one of these
devices, please enable support for them.
