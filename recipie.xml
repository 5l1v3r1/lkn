AO: Some general notes to remember:

I think it could get tiresome to keep saying "Then..." or "Also..."
I think you can just list steps. Readers will assume the steps are
done in order. Sometimes, readers may even want to skip around, so
order is not that important (for xconfig and menuconfig builds). I
did keep one "Also" below because it seemed to fit in well.

Avoid future tense; talk about what the kernel does in the present
(even though it will happen in the future, after building and
booting).

Refer to options such as "SCSI disk support" without any "the." You
can also say 'the "SCSI disk support" option' but there's no need to
add that extra text.

<para>
A USB Storage device is in reality a USB SCSI device that talks over a
USB connection.  Because of this, the SCSI subsystem must be enabled:
	Device Drivers
		SCSI Device Support
			<*> SCSI Device Support

Also in the SCSI system, the "SCSI disk support" must be enabled in
order for the device to be mounted properly:
	Device Drivers
		SCSI Device Support
			<*> SCSI disk support

Enable USB support for the kernel:
	Device Drivers
		USB Support
			<M> Support for Host-side USB

Also enable the USB Host controllers that allow USB to work properly on
the machine:
	Device Drivers
		USB Support
		---   USB Host Controller Drivers
		<M>   EHCI HCD (USB 2.0) support
		<M>   OHCI HCD support
		<M>   UHCI HCD (most Intel and VIA) support
Enable USB Storage support:
	Device Drivers
		USB Support
		<M> USB Mass Storage support

A number of specific USB storage devices are listed as separate
configuration items, as they do not follow the standard USB
specification and require special code.  If you have one of these
devices, please enable support for them.
