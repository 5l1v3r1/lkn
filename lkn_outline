Proposed Linux Kernel in a Nutshell chapter outline:

- Introduction or Foreword from some other kernel developer
- Kernel History and Background (just a few pages)
- Requirements to build a kernel
- Retrieving the kernel source
- Building a kernel
	- use the the default configuration options
	- basic options to make (full coverage will be in later
	  chapter).
	- building a kernel with the source in one place, and the output
	  in another.
	- building only a portion of the kernel tree
	- building a kernel for a different architecture
- Installing a built kernel and booting with it
	- grub
	- lilo
	- other boot loaders
- Upgrading the kernel to the next version
	- retrieving the patch
	- applying the patch
	- updating the configuration
	- building the updated kernel
- Configuring a kernel
	- text methods
		- make config
		- make oldconfig
		- make menuconfig
	- graphical methods
		- make xconfig
		- make gconfig
- Recipies for creating configurations
	- Disks
		- USB storage
		- SATA
		- cdrom burning
	- Devices
		- USB
		- firewire / ieee1394
		- PCI hotplug
		- PCMCIA
	- CPU
		- processor types
		- suspend
		- cpu frequency scaling
		- ACPI
		- SMP
		- different memory models
		- Preemption
	- Network stuff
		- Netfilter
		- network drivers
		- Irda
		- wireless
	- Filesystems
		- RAID
		- LVM
		- DM
		- Samba
		- Journaling filesystems
		- OCFS2
	- Security
		- SELinux
		- BSD Secure Levels
	- Kernel debugging
- Customizing the initramfs / initrd image
- Kernel boot command line reference
- Kernel build command line reference
- Kernel configuration option reference
	- will be only the most "important" ones, and will be the bulk
	  of the book (although the previous chapters will not be
	  "light".)
